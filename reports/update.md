# DynamiChat Messaging Network Project Update

Tolulope Oshinowo

The ultimate goal of DynamiChat is to serve as a messaging platform that can be accessed simply from the user’s terminal and an internet connection, allowing for a more streamlined and simplistic medium of communication. As was stated in the original proposal the lower bound was to set up a local chatting platform (which has since then been accomplished), and now developments in setting up a C server are underway to achieve the more ambitious objective of putting DynamiChat on the web. As of right now it seems as though the ultimate reach goal of putting DynamiChat on the blockchain may be out for reach due to time constraints.

Compared to the originally conceived learning goals of this project not much has changed. I am still looking to get a better understanding of how C can be used to create applications in online communications.

To get started I reverse-engineered the tee.c file to be able to create a system where messages could be sent and saved to a file that could simultaneously be read. For the most part I have not really used many external sources yet in terms of DynamiChat’s implementation. Most of the sources that I have utilized so far have come from HeadFirstC or previous homework exercises.

As was mentioned before work is underway to get a C server set up so that messages can be sent to and received from a local server instead of a local file. Once this has been accomplished the server will be hosted online where the messaging platform can be accessed from the internet. Some minimal aesthetics have been added in terms of varying colors on the terminal for different strings, but implementing ncurses is still a subject of interest. Specifically put the upcoming tasks to complete are to set up a local C server, find a place to host said server, and implement ncurses into the design of DynamiChat.

With each update regarding DynamiChat there has been an increase in morale to continue innovating upon the project, and things only look up from here.
