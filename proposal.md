# DynamiChat

Tolulope Oshinowo

In this technical exercise I will be attempting to develop a basic chatting platform that one can access from their terminal to communicate with others without worring about centralized surveillece from private institutions. At the very least DynamiChat would allow for users to leave messages in varying directories on their machine for others to find and reply to, but by the end of the exercise DynamiChat would be implemented with MongoDB to allow messages to be sent on the internet, sacrificing some anonymity for security. Additionally if time allows then DynamiChat would be implemented on the blockchain to allow for returned anonymity and security.

The reason that this exercise is being undertaken is to get a better understanding of how C can be used to create basic applications and to acheive a greater understanding of how online communications work. In order to get up to speed for this project the documentation regarding Mongo DB support for C will need to be looked into in addtion to the graphical capabilities of C as I would like to make the terminal interface look somewhat aesthetically pleasing.

To hit be sure that I can hit at least the minimum benchmark along with the others I need to do the following:
 - Create a basic graphical template in C.
 - Develop a script with basic directory and file manipulation (using tee.c as a basis should make this task simpler).
 - Set up a MongoDB database that I can GET from and POST to with C.
All of the aformentioned tasks will be done by me and will be initially showcased in individual C files with a working demonstration as a proof of concept for the culmulative idea.
